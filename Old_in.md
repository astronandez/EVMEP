# Abstract

Intelligent traffic systems (ITS) are becoming more common as cities continue to trend toward smart infrastructure. Sensors and systems like LIDAR, Radar, and Induction coils contribute toward smarter infrastructure but are limited to information a smaller subset of information and face scalability issues and high installation costs. In contrast, vision-based traffic solutions offer an in-depth analysis of the environment that can improve traffic management. Current, real-time computer-vision traffic systems have been capable of detecting vehicles and predicting trajectories but are computationally demanding and challenging to implement on resource-limited platforms. Nevertheless, advancements in Edge platforms and lightweight computer-vision object-tracking strategies make embedded systems an affordable and scalable alternative to larger systems. We’ll focus on optimizing our referenced pipeline on three distinct embedded platforms: Arduino® Nano 33 IoT,  Arduino® Nicla Vision, and the Raspberry Pi 4, each with two configurations Edge and cloud computing. With the information gathered from our evaluation, our group will be able to determine the system that provides the best balance of cost and performance.
